# Game_of_Life

## Description

John Conway, an English mathematician known for his research in combinatorial game theory, geometric topology, number theory, among many other areas, developed the game of life to build upon John von Neumann's work on cellular automata (Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata) published in 1966. This reposistory implements the classic game.
